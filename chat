Disaster Recovery (DR) Test Plan
1. Introduction
This test plan outlines the process for conducting a Disaster Recovery (DR) activity. The primary goal is to ensure that the failover, validation, failback, and production systems function as expected during and after the DR event.

2. Objectives
To validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the DR plan.
To ensure minimal downtime during the DR activity.
To confirm that all critical systems and applications can be recovered.
To validate data integrity and application functionality post-failover and post-failback.
3. Scope
This test plan covers:

Failover Procedure
Validation Procedure
Failback Procedure
Production Validation Procedure
4. Pre-Activity Checklist
Before initiating the DR activity, ensure the following:

All stakeholders are informed and available.
Communication channels are established.
Backup procedures are validated and recent backups are available.
A rollback plan is in place.
5. Failover Procedure
The failover procedure involves switching operations from the primary site to the DR site.

5.1 Steps:
Initiate Failover: Trigger the failover process according to the DR plan.
Switch DNS: Update DNS settings to point to the DR site.
Activate DR Systems: Start all necessary services and applications on the DR site.
Verify Connectivity: Ensure all users and systems can connect to the DR site.
Confirm Data Availability: Check that all critical data is available on the DR site.
5.2 Expected Outcomes:
All critical systems are operational at the DR site.
Data integrity is maintained.
Minimal downtime is experienced.
6. Validation Procedure
The validation procedure ensures that the DR site is functioning as expected after the failover.

6.1 Steps:
Application Validation: Test all critical applications for functionality.
Data Validation: Verify that data on the DR site matches the data on the primary site.
Performance Validation: Assess the performance of the DR site compared to the primary site.
User Access Validation: Ensure that users have the necessary access to applications and data.
Logging and Monitoring Validation: Confirm that logging and monitoring systems are active and accurate.
6.2 Expected Outcomes:
All applications function correctly.
Data is accurate and up-to-date.
Performance is within acceptable limits.
Users can access all required systems.
7. Failback Procedure
The failback procedure involves returning operations from the DR site to the primary site.

7.1 Steps:
Initiate Failback: Trigger the failback process according to the DR plan.
Sync Data: Ensure that all data changes at the DR site are synchronized with the primary site.
Switch DNS: Update DNS settings to point back to the primary site.
Deactivate DR Systems: Shut down services and applications on the DR site.
Verify Connectivity: Ensure all users and systems can connect to the primary site.
7.2 Expected Outcomes:
All critical systems are operational at the primary site.
Data is synchronized and accurate.
The DR site is properly deactivated.
8. Production Validation Procedure
The production validation procedure confirms that the primary site is fully operational and ready for regular operations.

8.1 Steps:
Application Validation: Test all critical applications on the primary site.
Data Validation: Verify that data on the primary site matches the data on the DR site before the failback.
Performance Validation: Assess the performance of the primary site.
User Access Validation: Ensure that users have the necessary access to applications and data.
Logging and Monitoring Validation: Confirm that logging and monitoring systems are active and accurate.
Business Process Validation: Ensure that all business processes are functioning as expected.
8.2 Expected Outcomes:
The primary site is fully operational.
Data is accurate and consistent.
All users and business processes are functioning normally.
9. Post-Activity Review
After the DR activity, conduct a review to assess the success of the failover, validation, failback, and production validation procedures.

9.1 Review Points:
Was the failover/failback process smooth?
Were there any data inconsistencies?
Did all applications function correctly?
Were users able to access systems as expected?
Were there any unexpected issues?
9.2 Documentation:
Record all findings, issues, and resolutions.
Update the DR plan if necessary.
10. Conclusion
The DR Test Plan is critical for ensuring that your organization can recover quickly and effectively in the event of a disaster. By following this plan, you can minimize downtime, protect data integrity, and ensure business continuity.
