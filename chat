Test Participants:
[Name], [Role]
[Name], [Role]
Objective of Test:
[Provide a brief description of the objective of the test, e.g., validate the recovery capabilities of critical systems during a failover event.]
2. Recovery Steps
Step-by-Step Process with Timing
For each recovery step, track the start and end times and document the outcome.

3. Documenting Issues and Unexpected Activities
Issues Encountered:
[List any issues or challenges faced during the test, with details on their nature and impact.]

Example: Issue with database synchronization, causing a 10-minute delay in the process.
Activities Not Included in Recovery Plan:
[Document any activities that arose during the test that were not initially planned for.]

Example: Unexpected network latency requiring manual intervention.
4. Validation Activities
Evidence of Validation
Provide validation evidence for each critical step.

Validation Activity	Evidence Type	Description of Validation	Attached Evidence (Yes/No)
Database Connection Test	Screenshot	Validated database connectivity post-failover	Yes
Web Application Validation	Log Export	Confirmed that the application is accessible	Yes
System Health Check	Checklist Completion	Checklist completed for service health	Yes

5. Scope Adjustments
Scope Reduction:
[If any activities were removed from the test scope, document them here.]

Scope Addition:
[If any additional activities were introduced during the test, describe them here.]

6. Post-Test Activities
Jira Issues Creation
For any issues encountered, create Jira stories for resolution. Document each issue ID and name here.

Issue ID	Issue Name	Description
DR-123	Database synchronization failure	Issue encountered during replication
DR-124	Slow system restart on DR site	Delayed service recovery post-failover
Summary of Test Activity and Results
Provide a summary of the test, including key results, successes, and areas of improvement.

Summary:
[Insert a high-level summary of the test activities, results, and whether objectives were met.]

Example: The failover test was partially successful. The failover process triggered successfully, but a delay occurred due to database replication issues. All critical applications were restored after 35 minutes, within the recovery time objective.
Evidence of Validation Activities
Attach the validation evidence (screenshots, logs, checklists, etc.) as part of this documentation.
